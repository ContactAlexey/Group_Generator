<h1 align="center">ðŸŽ² Random Group Generator ðŸŽ²</h1>
<p align="justify">This program allows you to create random groups, making it easier to organize teams for class assignments or collaborative projects.

It is especially useful for teachers, students, or anyone who needs to quickly and fairly divide a list of participants into pairs or small groups without repetition or bias.

The script automatically shuffles the names, forms groups of two, and handles cases where there's an odd number of people by assigning the remaining person to a solo group.</p>
